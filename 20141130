brought to you in collaboration with The Oxford India Centre for 
Sustainable Development.

* Recruiting Native Hindi and Urdu speakers

The Dahrendorf Programme for the Study of Freedom is looking for graduate
students to work with Professor Timothy Garton Ash on Free Speech Debate. This
is a multilingual, global online research project on free speech, concentrated
on the 13-language website http://www.freespeechdebate.com/en, which students
are encouraged to visit.

We are looking for students with native-speaker language skills in English,
Spanish, French, Hindi, Chinese, Turkish, German, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese,
Farsi, Japanese and Urdu.

**Specifically like to encourage native speakers of Hindi and Urdu to apply as
these languages are always under-represented in the applications.**

We are also looking for students with expertise in the study of freedom of
expression (including law, both common law and continental European law,
philosophy, and other disciplines), journalism (including experience of online
editing), the internet, the use of social media and open educational resources.

Hours are flexible and the position is paid at the research assistance rate of
Â£12.50/hour. We would very much prefer students who would be here until the end
of the academic year 2015/16 (i.e., summer 2016), although others may also
apply. You would be working with a stimulating and diverse team. For more
details and to apply please email tga.pa@sant.ox.ac.uk, attaching CV and
indicating native-speaker languages and other relevant expertise. Application
deadline is 5th December. Interviews for those shortlisted will be held in
early January.
