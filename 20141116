3. Prayog: Improving Education through Technology

Interested in improving education through technology? Looking for an
impactful volunteering experience abroad this summer? Want to visit India?

learning outcomes within a rural school in India. Prayog Education is back

We are an Oxford initiative which aims at improving the quality of life of
impoverished schools in the developing world by bringing together
