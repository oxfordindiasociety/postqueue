Reminder: OIS Hustings [23 November 2014, 7pm, Exeter College]

Dear members,

We shall have a meeting of the new prospective committee with OIS members,

It is a nice opportunity to meet the people who will be setting the path of
the Oxford India Society in 2015!

Time: Sunday 23 November 2014, 7pm onwards
Location: Saskatchewan Room, Exeter College

Regards
Team OIS
