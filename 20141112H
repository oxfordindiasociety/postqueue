Subject: OIS Elections: Final Call for Nominations [deadline 15 Nov midnight]

Dear members,

This is the final call for nominations for the elections of the Oxford
India Society. Please note that even if you are standing as part of a team,
nominations still need to be sent in individually.

We have our annual elections in Michaelmas Term to select the new committee
for 2015. Being a part of the committee is a great opportunity to organise
events, network, engage with charities, organise fun events like the
Bollywood Bop; and discover new ways to represent the uniquely diverse
community of Indian students in Oxford.

We are calling for nominations for the positions of
- President
- Secretary
- Treasurer

and also for the following teams (we are ideally looking for 3 people per
team).
- Systems
- Contact
- Events
- Publicity

People can nominate themselves for multiple teams, see
http://elections.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk/ for what each team does.

The deadline for receiving nominations is Sat Nov 15 2359 GMT 2014
All nominations should be sent to elections@oxfordindiasociety.org.uk

In the nomination email, please specify
 Subject: NOMINATION for <your name>
and in the text, a short bio (a couple of sentences). This will be put up
at http://elections.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk/ for our members.

We are going to have a meeting of the nominated candidates with the
outgoing committee members once the nominations are in.

Cheers
Team OIS
