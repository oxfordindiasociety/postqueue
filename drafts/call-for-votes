     Voting period starts      00:00:00 UTC on Monday, November 24th, 2014
     Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC on Friday, November 28th, 2014

HOW TO VOTE

First, read the full text of the platform.

To cast a vote, it is necessary to send this ballot filled out to a
dedicated e-mail address, in a signed message, as described below.
The dedicated email address this ballot should be sent to is:

  vote2015@oxfordindiasociety.org.uk

The form you need to fill out is contained at the bottom of this
message, marked with two lines containing the characters
'-=-=-=-=-=-'. Do not erase anything between those lines, and do not
change the choice names.

There are 2 choices in the form, which you may rank with numbers between
1 and 2. In the brackets next to your preferred choice, place a 1.
Place a 1 in the brackets next to your next choice. Continue until you
reach your last choice.  Do not enter a number smaller than 1 or larger than 3.

You may skip numbers, leave some choices unranked, and rank options
equally.  Unranked choices are considered equally the least desired
choices, and ranked below all ranked choices.

To vote "no, no matter what", rank "None Of The Above" as more desirable
than the unacceptable choices, or you may rank the "None Of The Above"
choice and leave choices you consider unacceptable blank.  (Note: if the
"None Of The Above" choice is unranked, then it is equal to all other
unranked choices, if any -- no special consideration is given to the
"None Of The Above" choice by the voting software).

Finally, mail the filled out ballot to: leader2014@vote.debian.org.

Don't worry about spacing of the columns or any quote characters (">") that
your reply inserts.

NOTE: The vote must be GPG signed (or PGP signed) with your key that is
in the Debian keyring.  You may, if you wish, choose to send a signed,
encrypted ballot: use the vote key appended below for encryption.
