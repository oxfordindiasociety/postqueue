Seminar on Bhopal Gas Tragedy [1 Dec 2014, 6.15pm, Somerville College]

Dear members,

The Oxford India Society, in collaboration with SOAS London is showing
webcast, followed by an online Q&A session on the 30th anniversary of the
Bhopal Gas Tragedy:

GLOBALIZATION SINCE BHOPAL: THREE DECADES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER

In commemoration of the Bhopal Disaster, this symposium reflects back on
the decades since that tragic night and asks what lessons have been
learned. Did the disaster entrench the inequalities inherent in exporting a
risky and hazardous technology in to a developing country, or have
regulatory advances since 1984 produced a safer and more equitable world?

Have the humanitarian, legal, and scientific institutions that were so
inadequate to respond to Bhopal become more sophisticated with time, or has
the legacy of Bhopal become a dangerous precedent for globalized corporate
impunity? 

Location: Flora Anderson Hall, Somerville College
Date: Monday, 1 December 2014

Schedule:
- 6.15pm Drinks reception
-    7pm Simulcast (from SOAS, London) begins

It features Dr.Vandana Shiva and Ravi Rajan (Associate Professor,
Department of Environmental Studies, University of California)

The lecture will be followed by a online Q&A session.

Regards
Team OIS
