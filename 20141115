[Details]

Tigmus, working with Oxford Pakistan Society and Oxford India Society ,
bring an amazing line up to Oxford featuring world-renowned tabla player
Shahbaz Hussain (Tabla Maestro) and the amazing singer/songwriter Tanya
Wells.

Shahbaz Hussain is regarded as one of the leading tabla virtuosos of his
generation. He has received numerous accolades for his captivating
performances, including receiving the prestigious “Son of Lahore” Award
from the Government of Pakistan in 2008.

Shahbaz began his grooming in the art of tabla at age five with his father,
the late Ustad Mumtaz Hussain – a prominent vocalist.

Shahbaz is an extremely versatile tabla player. He has mastered all the
imperative traditional skills as well as the ability to project those
skills to more contemporary styles. His solo performances have gained great
recognition all over the world. He is also much sought after for his
accompaniment skills by many of the great masters musicians of India &
Pakistan.

Shahbaz regularly travels across the world to present performances,
including throughout Europe, North America & the Asian subcontinent. He has
performed in many prestigious venues, including the Smithsonian Institute
in Washington D.C., Lincoln Center in New York and London's Royal Albert &
Queen Elizabeth Halls. His band, Indus, has received critical acclaim for
their debut album Firefly and they continue to tour the UK &
internationally.

Shahbaz will be joined by Tanya Wells. Tanya's musical inspirations span
far and wide...from American folk / blues / jazz to Indian classical music
and Sufiana Qalam.

Her nomadic upbringing has allowed her to express herself in culturally
diverse ways: She sings in Indian languages. Fundamentally, she's always on
the ear-out for heart-pumping soul music.
